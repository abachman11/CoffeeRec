# CoffeeRecs
## Andrew Bachman - Brew Better, LLC

This project will generate recommendations for coffees based on a users taste. The data used will be generated from twitter, as well as several other coffee related data sources. We will seek to generate recomendations based on a users past coffees, his reviews on those coffees and the comparisions. This project will be accessible via an HTTP API with routes to be defined later.

### Building and Running the project
These instructions should be kept up to date. The instructions should include all information needed to build/run the project (e.g., install nodejs, install Java 1.8.x, etc.). Anyone with reasonable computer knowledge should be able to checkout, build, run, and use your project by reading your clear and thorough directions. Make sure that you include examples of how to "use" your project after it is running (e.g., don't end with "Right-click, run as->Java Application").
