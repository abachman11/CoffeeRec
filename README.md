# CoffeeRec

Across different industries, our preferences are being used to generate recommendations of products we may like. Amazon recommends goods we might like based on our past purchases, and Netflix recommends movies based on our watching histories. This personalization makes it easier to make decisions and to find new products. Amazon and Netflix have the advantage of having a huge an established product that generates data to fuel their recommendation	 system. This project will seek to implement a system for recommending coffees. Without any large store of coffee data, an alternative solution will need to be used to generate the initial data for the recommendations. Mining twitter and correlating mentions of different coffees to the user that posts the tweet can generate this data store. By monitoring the tweets users make about different coffee, we will create an initial database of coffee preferences that can be used to generate recommendations

There are a huge number of coffee roasters and different coffees to choose from. This application will allow a user to track past coffees they have tried. The data will be compared with other users histories along with data from several other data sources to generate recommended coffees for a user. The recommendations will be integrated into an iOS mobile app to allow users to track coffees and view recommendations.


## Building and Running the project
These instructions should be kept up to date. The instructions should include all information needed to build/run the project (e.g., install nodejs, install Java 1.8.x, etc.). Anyone with reasonable computer knowledge should be able to checkout, build, run, and use your project by reading your clear and thorough directions. Make sure that you include examples of how to "use" your project after it is running (e.g., don't end with "Right-click, run as->Java Application").
